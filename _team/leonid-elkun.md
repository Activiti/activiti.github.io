I am a software architect with over two decades of professional experience. I specialize in designing and developing custom software solutions for enterprises. I am skilled in a variety of modern technologies and tools spanning across multiple specialty areas such as ESB, Messaging, Cloud, Content Management, BPM, Web and Mobile applications, etc. I am still an active Java developer. In the past, I’ve developed using other languages as well, e.g. C++ and C#. I’ve provided professional services to large enterprises, e.g. Nokia, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), World Bank and US Government (USCIS, Department of Homeland Security, FAA), as well as small private companies and startups.
